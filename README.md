# _Printf Function

This project implements a custom `printf` function in C, named `_printf`,
which allows you to format and print text to the standard output.
It closely resembles the behavior of the standard `printf` function in the
C library while maintaining a similar coding style.

## Introduction

The `_printf` function is designed to mimic the behavior of the standard `printf`
function in C. It accepts a format string and a variable number of arguments and prints
formatted output to the standard output (usually the terminal).

## Usage

To use the `_printf` function in your C program, include the `main.h` header file
and call the function like this:

```c
#include "main.h"

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    char *str = "Hello, world!";
    
    _printf("Number: %d\nString: %s\n", num, str);
    
    return 0;
}

Make sure to compile your program with the _printf.c file to link to the custom
printf implementation.

## Functionality
The _printf function supports various format specifiers, just like the standard printf
function. You can use format specifiers for integers, strings, characters, and more.

For example:

%d for integers
%s for strings
%c for characters
%f for floating-point numbers
You can also use flags for formatting, such as specifying the width and precision of the output.

## How to Compile
Compile your program with the custom printf implementation like this:

gcc -o my_program my_program.c _printf.c

Replace my_program with your program's name and _program.c with your source code file.
This command will link your program with the custom printf implementation.
